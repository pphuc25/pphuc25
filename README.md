## ðŸ”´ NOTE: I'm now a SaaS copywriter specializing in AI products

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is [Phuc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pphuc/)! Or you can call me Peter.

If you're wondering why an AI engineer's GitHub looks a bit quiet lately, here's my story:

After spending 4 years building NLP applications and publishing research, I noticed something frustrating: brilliant AI products were failing not only because of bad technology, but because of bad messaging.

Technical teams (myself included) were so deep in the code that we forgot how to talk to actual humans.

So I made a deliberate shift. I traded my IDE for a copywriting career, and honestly? It's been the best decision I've made.

Now I help AI SaaS companies translate their complex tech into clear, compelling messages that actually convert customers. The technical background isn't gathering dustâ€”it's my secret weapon. I can dive into your codebase, understand what your AI actually does, and explain it in a way that makes people want to buy it.

What's below:

This repo still shows my past lifeâ€”datasets with 700k+ Vietnamese language samples, multilingual medical speech recognition models, ASR systems. These projects taught me how AI systems think, which is exactly why I can now write about them in ways that non-technical buyers understand.

If you're building something in AI and your messaging feels off, I'm around. Always happy to chat.
