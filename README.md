## 🔴 NOTE: I'm now a Freelance SaaS Copywriter

Hi there 👋, If you're wondering why an AI engineer's GitHub looks quiet lately, here's the story:

My name is [Phuc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pphuc/)! Or you can call me Peter.

I spent 4 years building NLP applications and publishing research. Then I noticed something frustrating: brilliant AI products were failing not because of bad technology, but because of bad messaging. Technical teams (myself included) were so deep in the code that we forgot how to talk to actual humans.

After graduating top of my AI Engineering class, I made a deliberate shift. Studying AI was a personal mission—a way to rebuild my confidence after an academic setback. Mission accomplished. Now I'm free to pursue what I actually love: copywriting.

Turns out, my AI background is the perfect foundation. I spent years analyzing complex systems—now I use those same skills to craft sales arguments and funnels that convert.

So now, I help AI SaaS companies translate complex tech into clear, compelling messages. I can dive into your codebase, understand what your AI does, and explain it in ways that make people want to buy. I specialize in email sequences and full sales funnels that guide prospects from skeptical to sold.

**What's below:**

This repo still shows my past life—datasets with 700k+ Vietnamese language samples, multilingual medical speech recognition models, ASR systems. These projects taught me how AI systems think, which is exactly why I can now write about them in ways that non-technical buyers understand.

If you're building something in AI and your messaging feels off, I'm around. Always happy to chat.
